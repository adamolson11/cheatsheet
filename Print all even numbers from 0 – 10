// Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10
//you need two empty array objects. 
//then a way to traverse elements until 10
// then a way to store or PUSH the elements into an empty array
//then a method  to separate the elements in array1 into array2(evenArray). In JavaScript, you can use the filter() method to create a new array that contains only the elements of an existing array that satisfy a certain condition.
/*...Here's what each part of the code means:

num: This is the parameter of the function. It represents a single number that will be passed to the function as an argument.
=>: This is the arrow function syntax. It separates the function parameter(s) from the function body.
num % 2: This is the modulo operator %, which calculates the remainder of dividing num by 2. If num is an even number, the result will be 0; if it's an odd number, the result will be 1.
===: This is the strict equality operator. It compares the value on the left (num % 2) to the value on the right (0) and returns true if they are equal, false otherwise.
0: This is the value that num % 2 is being compared to. It represents an even number, since the remainder of dividing any even number by 2 is always 0.
The entire expression num % 2 === 0 is a boolean expression that evaluates to true if num is an even number and false if it's an odd number.*/


const countArray = []; //empty array 1 

for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {//traverses array
  countArray.push(i); //pushes the elements and stores them in the array
}
let evenNumbers= countArray.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); //this is literally says. inorder for array element to be true it must be divided by 2 and equal 0. 

let countEvenNumbers= evenNumbers;

console.log(evenNumbers); //finally print it to console

//now you need a filter out the even numbers using a method
